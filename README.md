# Python code for plate deflection with finite difference method

This is a Python application that I created as a homework for the Theory of Plates and Shells course in Istanbul Technical University. It calculates and plots the plate deflections, bending moments, and shear forces for a given problem by using the Finite Difference Method. The application has a user interface created using PyQt4 Designer. NumPy and Matplotlib are used for calculations and plotting.
